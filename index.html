            <p>Experienced System Administrator with a demonstrated history of working in the property
              management/construction & maintenance industry. Skilled in System Administration, Customer Service, Data
              Entry, Payroll, and Accounting. Strong information technology professional who is strengthening my
              background with a Certification focused in Full Stack Web Development from the University of Minnesota
              College of Continuing & Professional Studies.</p>

            <p>Curious by nature, I shifted interests to coding when I became a system administrator and wanted/needed
              to be able to do more with the system than I knew how. Enter University of Minnesota's coding bootcamp,
              where I have been overwhelmed with coding knowledge and hope to come out the other side an extremely
              skilled Googler. </p>

            <p>In my free time I enjoy getting outside and exploring with my energetic pup. Fitness is an important part
              of my life and fit that in wherever I can.</p>
